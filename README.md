# Owlready2-for-biomedical-ontologies

Ontologies are widely used in the biomedical domain. While many tools exist for the edition, alignment or evaluation of
ontologies, few solutions have been proposed for ontology programming interface, i.e. for accessing and modifying an ontology within
a programming language. Existing query languages (such as SPARQL) and APIs (such as OWLAPI) are not as easy-to-use as object
programming languages are. Moreover, they provide few solutions to difficulties encountered with biomedical ontologies. Our objective
was to design a tool for accessing easily the entities of an OWL ontology, with high-level constructs helping with biomedical ontologies.
